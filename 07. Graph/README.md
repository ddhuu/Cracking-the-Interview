# Graph Algorithm && Application
## 01. Connected Graph
You are givem a directed graph as input. The task is check if the graph is connected or not.
## 02. Detect cycle in the undirected graph
Given a undirected graph, write an algorithm to find out whether graph contains cycle or not in Time Complexity O(Vertex + Edge) and Space Complexity O(Vertex).
## 03. Find Path 
Given a 2d matrix, find a path from the top left corner to bottom right corner. Assume there exists at least one path, and you only need to find one valid path. You can move up, right, down, left at any position with extra Space Complexity O(m + n).
## 04. Topological Sorting
The topological sort algorithm takes a directed graph and returns an array of the nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to.
