# Graph Algorithm && Application
## 01. Connected Graph
You are givem a directed graph as input. The task is check if the graph is connected or not.
## 02. Detect cycle in the undirected graph
Given a undirected graph, write an algorithm to find out whether graph contains cycle or not in Time Complexity O(Vertex + Edge) and Space Complexity O(Vertex).
