# Dynamic Programing
## 01. Longest Common Subsequences
Given two strings of length m and n, find the length of their longest subsequence in Time Complexity and Space Complexity O(m*n).
## 02. Edit String Distance
Given two words word1 of length m and word2 of length n, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2 in Time and Space Complexity O(mn). You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word: 1. Insert a character 2. Delete a character 3. Replace a character.
## 03. Sub Array sums equal K
Given an array [] of length N and an integer Sum , the task is to find the number of subsets with equal to sum.
