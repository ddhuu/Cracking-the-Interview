# Dynamic Programing
## 01. Longest Common Subsequences
Given two strings of length m and n, find the length of their longest subsequence in Time Complexity and Space Complexity O(m*n).
## 02. Edit String Distance
Given two words word1 of length m and word2 of length n, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2 in Time and Space Complexity O(mn). You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word: 1. Insert a character 2. Delete a character 3. Replace a character.
## 03. Sub Array sums equal K
Given an array [] of length N and an integer Sum , the task is to find the number of subsets with equal to sum. 
## 04. Coin Change
Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the total number of distinct ways to get a desired change in Time and Space Complexity in O(n^2).
## 05. Maximum Profit in Jobs Scheduling
 We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, you need to output the maximum profit you can take such that there are no 2 jobs in the subset with an overlapping time range.If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X
