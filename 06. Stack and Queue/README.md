# Stack and Queue
## 01. Circular Queue implementation
Circular queue is a linear data structure in which operations are performed based on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle; The last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
## 02. Histogram Problem
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the this histogram.
## 03. Valid Parentheses
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.An input string is valid if:Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
## 04. Stack that Supports getMin() in O(1)
Design a data structure which support push()/pop()/findminimum() operation in O(1) time.
## 05. Reverse Words in a String
 Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
